### Creational Design Pattern:

creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object 
creation mechanisms.
trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

* Factory Method : The factory design pattern is used when we have a 
                     superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input,
                     we need to return one of the sub-class
                     
* Abstract Factory Method
* Builder Method
* Prototype Method
* Singleton Method

### Structural Design Patterns:
Structural design pattern is a blueprint of how different objects and
classes are combined together to form a bigger structure for 
achieving multiple goals altogether

* Adapter Method
* Bridge Method
* Composite Method
* Decorator Method
* Facade Method : It will help us to hide the complexity of the subsystem.
* Proxy Method: : When you want to add some additional behaviors to an 
                  object of some existing class without changing the client code.
* FlyWeight Method

### Behavioral Design Pattern:
behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify 
common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. 
By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication

* Chain of Responsibility Method
* Command Method
* Iterator Method
* Mediator Method
* Memento Method
* Observer Method
* State Method
* Strategy Method
* Template Method
* Visitor Method

### Advantages of using Design Patterns
Reusability 
Transparent
Established Solution 
Established Communication
Efficient Development 

### proxy vs facade
The proxy pattern is where one object acts as an interface to another object.
The difference between proxy and facade patterns are that 
we can proxies create interfaces for one object. 
But facades can be interfaces for anything.

### proxy vs decorator
Although Proxy and Decorator patterns have similar structures, 
they differ in intention; while Proxy's prime purpose is to facilitate ease 
of use or controlled access, a Decorator attaches additional responsibilities. 
Both Proxy and Adapter patterns hold a reference to the original object
